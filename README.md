**Stellar Wallet:**

A decentralized expense-splitting app built on the Stellar Testnet.
Stellar Wallet lets groups track shared expenses and settle balances using Stellar testnet assets in a transparent, super fast, and low-fee environment.

**Overview:**

Stellar Wallet enables users to:
Create shared expense groups
Add and split expenses between members
Track who owes whom
Settle balances using Stellar testnet payments
View transaction history recorded on-chain
All settlements are executed on the Stellar Testnet, making it ideal for experimentation and learning without real financial risk.

**Built on Stellar:**

Stellar Development Foundation maintains the Stellar network, a decentralized blockchain designed for fast, low-cost financial transactions.
Stellar Testnet is a testing environment that mirrors the main network but uses test tokens instead of real assets.
