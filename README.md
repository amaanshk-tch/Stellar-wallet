**Stellar Wallet:**

A decentralized expense-splitting app built on the Stellar Testnet.
Stellar Wallet lets groups track shared expenses and settle balances using Stellar testnet assets in a transparent, fast, and low-fee environment.

🚀 Overview

Stellar Wallet enables users to:

Create shared expense groups

Add and split expenses between members

Track who owes whom

Settle balances using Stellar testnet payments

View transaction history recorded on-chain

All settlements are executed on the Stellar Testnet, making it ideal for experimentation and learning without real financial risk.

🌌 Built on Stellar

Stellar Development Foundation maintains the Stellar network, a decentralized blockchain designed for fast, low-cost financial transactions.

Stellar Testnet is a testing environment that mirrors the main network but uses test tokens instead of real assets.

Why Stellar?
